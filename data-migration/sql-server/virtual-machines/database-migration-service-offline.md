# Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine with Azure DMS (offline)

You can use Azure Database Migration Service (Azure DMS) through the Azure portal to migrate databases from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to [What is SQL Server on Azure Windows Virtual Machines?](/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview) (Azure VM) with minimal downtime.

For database migration methods that might require some manual configuration, see [SQL Server instance migration to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/azure-sql/migration-guides/virtual-machines/sql-server-to-sql-on-azure-vm-migration-overview).

In this tutorial, you migrate the `AdventureWorks2025` database from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to a SQL Server on Azure VM with minimal downtime, using Azure DMS.

> [!NOTE]  
> This tutorial uses offline migration mode, which includes some acceptable downtime during the migration process. For online migration options, see [Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine with Azure DMS (online)](database-migration-service-online.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Launch the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard in the Azure portal.
> - Specify details of your source SQL Server, backup location, and your target SQL Server on Azure VM.
> - Configure the wizard to access source server and backups.
> - Start and monitor the progress for your migration.
> - Perform the migration cutover when you're ready.

## Migration options

The following section describes how to use Azure Database Migration Service with the Azure SQL migration extension, or in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

## [Migrate using Azure portal](#tab/portal)

Before you begin the tutorial:

- Ensure that you can access the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

- Make sure that the **Microsoft.DataMigration** resource provider is [registered in your subscription](/azure/dms/quickstart-create-data-migration-service-portal#register-the-resource-provider).

- Have an Azure account that's assigned to one of the following built-in roles:

  - **Contributor** for the target instance of SQL Server on an Azure VM, and for the storage account where you upload your database backup files from a Server Message Block (SMB) network share.

  - **Reader** role for the Azure resource group that contains the target instance of SQL Server on an Azure VM or for your Azure Storage account.

  - **Owner** or **Contributor** role for the Azure subscription.

  - As an alternative to using one of these built-in roles, you can [assign custom roles](custom-roles.md).

  When you use the **Azure portal** to migrate, the signed-in user must have **Storage Blob Data Reader** access on the blob container that holds the backup files, to be able to list files and folders during migration setup.

## [Migrate using Azure SQL migration extension](#tab/extension)

Before you begin the tutorial:

- Download and install [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) and the [Azure SQL migration extension](/azure-data-studio/extensions/azure-sql-migration-extension).

- Have an Azure account that's assigned to one of the following built-in roles:

  - **Contributor** for the target instance of SQL Server on an Azure VM, and for the storage account where you upload your database backup files from a Server Message Block (SMB) network share.

  - **Reader** role for the Azure resource group that contains the target instance of SQL Server on an Azure VM or for your Azure Storage account.

  - **Owner** or **Contributor** role for the Azure subscription.

  - As an alternative to using one of these built-in roles, you can [assign custom roles](custom-roles.md).

  You need an Azure account only when you configure the migration steps. You don't need an Azure account for the assessment or to view Azure recommendations in the migration wizard in Azure Data Studio.

  When you use the **Azure portal** to migrate, the signed-in user must have **Storage Blob Data Reader** access on the blob container that holds the backup files, to be able to list files and folders during migration setup.

## Start a new migration

This tutorial describes an offline migration from SQL Server to SQL Server on an Azure VM.

## [Migrate using Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To start a new migration:

1. Go to [Azure Database Migration Service](https://portal.azure.com) in the Azure portal. Use **+Create** to create a new instance of Database Migration Service, or select an existing instance. Then, go to your Database Migration Service instance.

1. On the **Overview** pane of your Azure DMS instance, select **New migration**.

1. Under **Select new migration** scenario, choose your source, target server type, backup file storage location, migration mode as **Offline migration**, and choose **Select**.

   Your database backups can be located either on an on-premises network share or in an Azure Storage blob container.

   :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new migration scenario." lightbox="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-01.png":::

   In offline migration mode, the source SQL Server database shouldn't be used for write activity while database backup files are restored on the target instance of SQL Server on an Azure VM. Application downtime persists from the start of the migration process until it's finished.

1. On the **Azure SQL Virtual Machine Online Blob Migration Wizard**, follow these steps:

   1. On the **Source details** tab, enter details for the source SQL Server instance, then select **Next: Connect to source SQL Server**.

   1. On the **Select migration target** tab, enter details for the subscription, resource group, and target SQL Server VM. Then select **Next: Data source configuration**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot of offline blob migration wizard." lightbox="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-02.png":::

      - Always use a dedicated storage account for migration. Sharing it with other workloads can lead to conflicts and security risks.

      - Once migration is done, either rotate the Storage Account Key to keep backups secure, or delete the storage account if it's no longer needed.

      - Azure DMS doesn't take database backups, and doesn't initiate any database backups on your behalf. Instead, the service uses existing database backup files for the migration.

      - If your database backup files are in an SMB network share, [create an Azure Storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) that allows Azure DMS to upload the database backup files, and to migrate databases. Make sure you create the Azure Storage account in the same region where you create your instance of Azure DMS.

      - You can write each backup to either a separate backup file or to multiple backup files. Appending multiple backups such as full and transaction logs into a single backup media isn't supported.

      - You can provide compressed backups to reduce the likelihood of experiencing potential issues associated with migrating large backups.

   1. In the **Data source configuration** step, select the location of your database backups. Your database backups can be located either on an on-premises network share or in an Azure Storage blob container.

      If you provide your database backups in an on-premises network share, set up a self-hosted integration runtime in the next step of the wizard. You need a self-hosted integration runtime to access your source database backups, check the validity of the backup set, and upload backups to Azure storage account. If your database backups are already in an Azure storage blob container, you don't need a self-hosted integration runtime.

      - For backups that are stored in an Azure Storage blob container, enter or select the following information:

        | Name | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Resource group** | The resource group where backup files are located. |
        | **Storage account details** | The storage account where backup files are located. |
        | **Blob container** | The blob container where backup files are located. |
        | **Folder** | The folder where backup files are located. |
        | **Last Backup File** | The file name of the last backup of the database you're migrating. |
        | **Target database name** | You can modify the target database name during the migration process. |

        If loopback check functionality is enabled and the source SQL Server and file share are on the same computer, the source can't access the file share with the FQDN. To fix this issue, [disable loopback check functionality](/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/accessing-server-locally-with-fqdn-cname-alias-denied).

        :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot of offline blob migration wizard data source configuration." lightbox="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-03.png":::

      - For backups that are located on a network share, enter the following additional information on the respective pages.

        | Name | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Source server name** | The FQDN or IP of the source server. Ensure that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has read privileges on the network share. |
        | **Authentication Type** | Select the authentication type: SQL or Windows |
        | **Source Credentials - Username** | The credential (Windows and SQL authentication) to connect to the source SQL Server instance and validate the backup files. |
        | **Source Credentials - Password** | The credential (Windows and SQL authentication) to connect to the source SQL Server instance and validate the backup files. |
        | **Network share location that contains backups** | The network share location that contains the full and transaction log backup files. The migration process automatically ignores any invalid files or backup files in the network share that don't belong to the valid backup set. |
        | **Windows user account with read access to the network share location** | The Windows credential (username) that has read access to the network share to retrieve the backup files. |
        | **Password** | The Windows credential (password) that has read access to the network share to retrieve the backup files. |
        | **Target database name** | You can modify the target database name during the migration process. |

## [Migrate using Azure SQL migration extension](#tab/extension)

To start a new migration:

1. In Azure Data Studio, go to **Connections**. Select and connect to your on-premises instance of SQL Server. You can also connect to SQL Server on an Azure VM.

1. Right-click the server connection and select **Manage**.

1. In the server menu under **General**, select **Azure SQL Migration**.

1. In the Azure SQL Migration dashboard, select **Migrate to Azure SQL** to open the migration wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service/launch-migrate-to-azure-sql-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to open the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard." lightbox="media/database-migration-service/launch-migrate-to-azure-sql-wizard.png":::

1. On the first page of the wizard, start a new session or resume a previously saved session.

## Run a database assessment, collect performance data, and get Azure recommendations

1. In **Step 1: Databases for assessment** in the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard, select the databases you want to assess. Then, select **Next**.

1. In **Step 2: Assessment results and recommendations**, complete the following steps:

   1. In **Choose your Azure SQL target**, select **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machine**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service/assessment-complete-target-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an assessment confirmation.":::

   1. Select **View/Select** to view the assessment results.

   1. In the assessment results, select the database, then review the assessment report to make sure no issues were found.

   1. Select **Get Azure recommendation** to open the recommendations pane.

   1. Select **Collect performance data now**. Select a folder on your local computer to store the performance logs, then select **Start**.

      Azure Data Studio collects performance data until you either stop data collection or you close Azure Data Studio.

      After 10 minutes, Azure Data Studio indicates that a recommendation is available for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. After the first recommendation is generated, you can select **Restart data collection** to continue the data collection process and refine the SKU recommendation. An extended assessment is especially helpful if your usage patterns vary over time.

   1. In the selected **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines** target, select **View details** to open the detailed SKU recommendation report:

   1. In **Review SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines Recommendations**, review the recommendation. To save a copy of the recommendation, select the **Save recommendation report** checkbox.

1. Select **Close** to close the recommendations pane.

1. Select **Next** to continue your database migration in the wizard.

## Configure migration settings

1. In **Step 3: Azure SQL target** in the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard, select your Azure account, Azure subscription, the Azure region or location, and the resource group that contains the target SQL Server to Azure Virtual Machines instance. Then, select **Next**.

1. In **Step 4: Migration mode**, select **Offline migration**, then select **Next**.

   In offline migration mode, the source SQL Server database shouldn't be used for write activity while database backup files are restored on the target instance of SQL Server to Azure Virtual Machines. Application downtime persists from the start of the migration process until it's finished.

1. In **Step 5: Data source configuration**, select the location of your database backups. Your database backups can be located either on an on-premises network share or in an Azure storage blob container.

   If you provide your database backups in an on-premises network share, set up a self-hosted integration runtime in the next step of the wizard. You need a self-hosted integration runtime to access your source database backups, check the validity of the backup set, and upload backups to Azure storage account. If your database backups are already in an Azure storage blob container, you don't need a self-hosted integration runtime.

   - For backups that are located on a network share, enter or select the following information:

     | Name | Description |
     | --- | --- |
     | **Source Credentials - Username** | The credential (Windows and SQL authentication) to connect to the source SQL Server instance and validate the backup files. |
     | **Source Credentials - Password** | The credential (Windows and SQL authentication) to connect to the source SQL Server instance and validate the backup files. |
     | **Network share location that contains backups** | The network share location that contains the full and transaction log backup files. The migration process automatically ignores any invalid files or backup files in the network share that don't belong to the valid backup set. |
     | **Windows user account with read access to the network share location** | The Windows credential (username) that has read access to the network share to retrieve the backup files. |
     | **Password** | The Windows credential (password) that has read access to the network share to retrieve the backup files. |
     | **Target database name** | You can modify the target database name during the migration process. |

   - For backups that are stored in an Azure storage blob container, enter or select the following information:

     | Name | Description |
     | --- | --- |
     | **Target database name** | You can modify the target database name during the migration process. |
     | **Storage account details** | The resource group, storage account, and container where backup files are located. |
     | **Last Backup File** | The file name of the last backup of the database you're migrating. |

     If loopback check functionality is enabled and the source SQL Server and file share are on the same computer, the source won't be able to access the file share by using the FQDN. To fix this issue, [disable loopback check functionality](/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/accessing-server-locally-with-fqdn-cname-alias-denied).

### Backup storage scenarios

The [Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio](/azure/dms/migration-using-azure-data-studio) doesn't require specific configurations on your Azure Storage account network settings to migrate your SQL Server databases to Azure.

[!INCLUDE [data-migration-storage-access](../../includes/data-migration-storage-access.md)]

## Create a Database Migration Service instance

## [Migrate using Azure portal](#tab/portal)

[!INCLUDE [create-database-migration-service-instance](../../includes/create-database-migration-service-instance.md)]

## [Migrate using Azure SQL migration extension](#tab/extension)

In **Step 6: Azure Database Migration Service** in the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard, create a new instance of Azure Database Migration Service or reuse an existing instance that you created earlier.

If you previously created a Database Migration Service instance by using the Azure portal, you can't reuse the instance in the migration wizard in Azure Data Studio. You can reuse an instance only if you created the instance by using Azure Data Studio.

### Use an existing instance of Database Migration Service

To use an existing instance of Database Migration Service:

1. In **Resource group**, select the resource group that contains an existing instance of Database Migration Service.

1. In **Azure Database Migration Service**, select an existing instance of Database Migration Service that's in the selected resource group.

1. Select **Next**.

### Create a new instance of Database Migration Service

To create a new instance of Database Migration Service, follow these steps:

1. In **Resource group**, create a new resource group to contain a new instance of Database Migration Service.

1. Under **Azure Database Migration Service**, select **Create new**.

1. In **Create Azure Database Migration Service**, enter a name for your Database Migration Service instance, then select **Create**.

1. Under **Set up integration runtime**, complete the following steps:

   1. Select the **Download and install integration runtime** link to open the download link in a web browser. Download the integration runtime, then install it on a computer that meets the prerequisites to connect to the source SQL Server instance.

      When installation finishes, Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager automatically opens to begin the registration process.

   1. In the **Authentication key** table, copy one of the authentication keys that the wizard provides and paste it in Azure Data Studio. If the authentication key is valid, a green check icon appears in Integration Runtime Configuration Manager. A green check indicates that you can continue to **Register**.

      After you register the self-hosted integration runtime, close Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager.

      For more information about how to use the self-hosted integration runtime, see [Create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime](/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime).

1. In **Create Azure Database Migration Service** in Azure Data Studio, select **Test connection** to validate that the newly created Database Migration Service instance is connected to the newly registered self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Return to the migration wizard in Azure Data Studio.

---

## Start the database migration

## [Migrate using Azure portal](#tab/portal)

On the **Database migration summary** tab, review the details, then select **Start migration**. The service starts the database migration and automatically takes you back to the Azure DMS dashboard.

:::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot of offline blob migration wizard data migration summary." lightbox="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-04.png":::

## [Migrate using Azure SQL migration extension](#tab/extension)

In **Step 7: Summary** in the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard, review the configuration you created, then select **Start migration** to start the database migration.

---

## Monitor the database migration

## [Migrate using Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. To monitor your database migration, on the **Overview** pane of your DMS instance, select **Monitor migrations**.

1. Under the **Migrations** tab, you can track migrations that are in progress, completed, and failed (if any), or you can view all database migrations. In the menu bar, select **Refresh** to update the migration status.

   :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-05.png" alt-text="Screenshot of monitoring the migration." lightbox="media/database-migration-service-offline/offline-vm-05.png":::

## [Migrate using Azure SQL migration extension](#tab/extension)

1. In Azure Data Studio, in the server menu under **General**, select **Azure SQL Migration** to go to the dashboard for your Azure SQL migrations.

   Under **Database migration status**, you can track migrations that are in progress, completed, and failed (if any), or you can view all database migrations.

   :::image type="content" source="media/database-migration-service/monitor-migration-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of monitor migration dashboard.":::

1. Select **Database migrations in progress** to view active migrations.

   To get more information about a specific migration, select the database name.

---

Azure DMS returns the latest known migration status each time migration status refreshes. The following table describes possible statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Arrived** | The backup file arrived in the source backup location and was validated. |
| **Uploading** | The integration runtime is uploading the backup file to Azure storage. |
| **Uploaded** | The backup file was uploaded to Azure storage. |
| **Restoring** | The service is restoring the backup file to SQL Server on an Azure VM. |
| **Restored** | The backup file was successfully restored on SQL Server on an Azure VM. |
| **Canceled** | The migration process was canceled. |
| **Ignored** | The backup file was ignored because it doesn't belong to a valid database backup chain. |

After all database backups are restored on the instance of SQL Server on an Azure VM, Azure DMS initiates an automatic migration cutover to ensure that the migrated database is ready to use. The migration status changes from **In progress** to **Succeeded**.

## Limitations

If you migrate a single database, you must place the database backups in a flat-file structure inside a database folder (including container root folder). You can't nest these folders, as nesting isn't supported.

If you migrate multiple databases using the same Azure Blob Storage container, you must place backup files for different databases in separate folders inside the container.

You can't overwrite existing databases in your target SQL Server on an Azure VM using DMS.

Azure DMS doesn't support configuring high availability and disaster recovery on your target to match source topology.

The following server objects aren't supported:

- SQL Server Agent jobs
- Credentials
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages
- Server audit

You can't use an existing self-hosted integration runtime created from Azure Data Factory (ADF) for database migrations with DMS. Initially, you should create the self-hosted integration runtime using the Azure SQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio. You can reuse it for further database migrations.

VMs with target versions of SQL Server 2008 and older aren't supported when migrating to SQL Server on an Azure VM.

If you use a VM with SQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2014, you need to store your source database backup files on an Azure Storage blob container instead of using the network share option. Store the backup files as page blobs since block blobs are only supported in SQL Server 2016 and later versions.

You must make sure the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension in the target Azure VM is in **Full mode** instead of Lightweight mode.

Migration to Azure SQL VM using DMS uses SQL Server IaaS agent internally. SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension only supports management of default server instance or single named instance.

You can migrate a maximum of 100 databases to the same Azure VM as the target using one or more migrations simultaneously. Moreover, once a migration with 100 databases finishes, wait for at least 30 minutes before starting a new migration to the same SQL Server on an Azure VM as the target. Also, every migration operation (start migration, cutover) for each database takes a few minutes sequentially. For example, to migrate 100 databases, it might take approximately 200 (2 x 100) minutes to create the migration queues and approximately 100 (1 x 100) minutes to cutover all 100 databases (excluding backup and restore timing). Therefore, the migration becomes slower as the number of databases increases. You should either schedule a longer migration window in advance based on rigorous migration testing, or partition large numbers of databases into batches when migrating them to SQL Server on an Azure VM.

Apart from configuring the Networking/Firewall of your Azure Storage account to allow your VM to access backup files, you also need to configure the Networking/Firewall of your SQL Server on an Azure VM to allow outbound connection to your storage account.

You need to keep the target Azure VM **powered on** while the SQL Server migration is in progress. Also, when creating a new migration, failover or cancel the migration.

### Possible error messages

#### Login failed for user 'NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery

**Error**: `Login failed for user 'NT Service\SQLIaaSExtensionQuery`

**Reason**: SQL Server instance is in single-user mode. One possible reason is the target SQL Server VM is in upgrade mode.

**Solution**: Wait for the target SQL Server VM to exit the upgrade mode, and start migration again.

#### Failed to create restore job

**Error**: `Ext_RestoreSettingsError, message: Failed to create restore job.;Cannot create file 'F:\data\XXX.mdf' because it already exists.`

**Solution**: Connect to the target SQL Server VM and delete the `XXX.mdf` file. Then, start migration again.
