# Use contained databases with Always On availability groups

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This article contains information about the using a contained database with [!INCLUDE [ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

## Prerequisites

Before adding a contained database to an availability group, ensure that the `contained database authentication` server configuration option is set to `1` on every server instance that hosts an availability replica for the availability group.

For more information, see [Server Configuration: contained database authentication](../../configure-windows/contained-database-authentication-server-configuration-option.md).
