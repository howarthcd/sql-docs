# Manage queues and messages

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdbmi](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

When a Service Broker application is in production, most day-to-day management occurs as a normal part of maintenance of the Database Engine. Service Broker provides performance counters and event notifications to monitor a service. However, you might have to work directly with a message queue or with the messages in a queue. This might be necessary to troubleshoot a service or to collect information about the traffic that is received by a queue.
