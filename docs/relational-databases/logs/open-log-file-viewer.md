# Open Log File Viewer

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

You can use Log File Viewer in [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to access information about errors and events that are captured in the following logs:

- Audit collection
- Data collection
- Database Mail
- Job history
- SQL Server
- SQL Server Agent
- Windows events (These Windows events can also be accessed from Event Viewer.)

You can use Registered Servers to view [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] log files from local or remote instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By using Registered Servers, you can view the log files when the instances are either online or offline.

For more information about how to access offline [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] log files, see [View Offline Log Files](view-offline-log-files.md).

You can open Log File Viewer in several ways, depending on the information that you want to view.

## Permissions

To access log files for instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that are online, this requires membership in the **securityadmin** fixed server role.

To access log files for instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that are offline, you must have read access to both the `Root\Microsoft\SqlServer\ComputerManagement10` WMI namespace, and to the folder where the log files are stored. For more information, see the Security section of the topic [View Offline Log Files](view-offline-log-files.md).
