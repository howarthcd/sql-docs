# Known issues: SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc

This article provides information about known issues associated with SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc.

## Databases

If a database isn't online and updatable, required permissions aren't assigned to that database. Features requiring permissions to that database are affected.

### Resolution

- Verify that the databases are online and updateable. Review [Verify state of user databases](prerequisites.md#verify-state-of-user-databases).

- Check the error logs. The error log might show Microsoft SQL Server error 945:

  ```output
  Database cannot be opened due to inaccessible files or insufficient memory or disk space
  ```

  To resolve, follow the steps at [MSSQLSERVER_945](../../relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-945-database-engine-error.md).

## Cost report tags

Currently `Microsoft.AzureArcData` tags are not included in cost reports. For updates, review [Microsoft.AzureArcData tag support](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-support#microsoftazurearcdata)

## Throttling errors

You might occasionally see throttling notifications for Azure resource updates in Activity log, as shown below. This behavior is expected due to service-imposed rate limits. Updates for SQL Server instances, databases, and availability groups inventory run continuously on an hourly basis and should eventually complete successfully.

Contact the support team for assistance if you:

- Encounter these errors repeatedly
- Notice data inconsistencies in Azure for your SQL Server instances, databases, or availability groups
- Experience failures when using other features of SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc
