# SQL projects tools

Tooling for SQL projects is available in several development environments and command line interfaces. The primary tools for SQL projects are the **SqlPackage** command line utility, **SQL Server Data Tools** (SSDT) in Visual Studio, and the **SQL Database Projects extension** for Visual Studio Code.

Tools included in this article:

- [Graphical tools](#graphical-tools)
  - [SQL Database Projects extension](../visual-studio-code-extensions/sql-database-projects/sql-database-projects-extension.md)
  - [SQL Server Data Tools](../../ssdt/sql-server-data-tools.md)
- [Command line tools](#command-line-tools)
  - [SqlPackage](../sqlpackage/sqlpackage.md)

## Graphical tools

These tools provide a graphical interface for SQL projects, a T-SQL editor, and a build and publish process.

[SQL Database Projects extension](../visual-studio-code-extensions/sql-database-projects/sql-database-projects-extension.md) is an extension for **Visual Studio Code**. This extension provides a graphical interface for SQL projects, a T-SQL editor, and a build and publish process.

[SQL Server Data Tools](../../ssdt/sql-server-data-tools.md) (SSDT) is a **Visual Studio** component that provides a graphical interface for SQL projects. SSDT provides a visual designer for tables, a T-SQL editor, and a build and publish process.

## Command line tools

[SqlPackage](../sqlpackage/sqlpackage.md) is the primary command line utility for the DacFx library, enabling automation of the database development tasks such as deploying a `.dacpac` to a database or extracting the objects of a database to a SQL project or `.dacpac`.

Custom console applications can be built using the DacFx .NET library to automate database development tasks. The [Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac](/dotnet/api/microsoft.sqlserver.dac) namespace contains classes for creating, deploying, and extracting database objects and is foundational to the rest of the DacFx library.

CI/CD pipelines can be built with command line execution or with tasks specific to `.dacpac` and SQL projects deployment. The [GitHub sql-action](https://github.com/azure/sql-action) and [SqlAzureDacpacDeployment in Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/sql-azure-dacpac-deployment-v1) are examples of tasks that use SqlPackage underneath a management layer to facilitate deploying database changes.

### Conversion tools

The process of converting an [existing SQL project to an SDK-style project](howto/convert-original-sql-project.md) is done by manually editing the `.sqlproj` file to include the new SDK-style project format. Before beginning the process, it's recommended to both back up the project file and archive a `.dacpac` of the project. By comparing a "before" and "after" `.dacpac` built from the project, you can ensure that the conversion process has correctly completed.

### Project/solution management

Multiple SQL projects (and other projects) can be logically grouped together in a solution file. The solution file is a container for one or more projects and is used to manage the projects as a group, including the build action. Large solutions can be broken down into smaller solutions to improve performance and manageability, or dynamically generated for the appropriate task at hand. The [slngen solution file generator](https://github.com/microsoft/slngen) is available for Microsoft.Build.Sql projects and can be used to create a solution file for a set of projects programmatically and on-demand.

## Third-party tools

There are third-party tools available that provide functionality related to SQL projects and database deployment. Some tools are open source, such as [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/Publish-DbaDacPackage).

Developers have shared their projects utilizing extensibility points around SQL projects, including [code analysis](concepts/sql-code-analysis/sql-code-analysis.md) rules and customizing deployment plans. Some of these projects are:

- <https://github.com/tcartwright/SqlServer.Rules>
- <https://github.com/davebally/TSQL-Smells>
- <https://github.com/ErikEJ/SqlServer.Rules>
- <https://github.com/GoEddie/DeploymentContributorFilterer>
