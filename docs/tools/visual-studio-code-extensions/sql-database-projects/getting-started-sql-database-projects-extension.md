# Get started with the SQL Database Projects extension

[!INCLUDE [azure-data-studio-deprecation](../../../includes/azure-data-studio-deprecation.md)]

This article describes three ways to get started with the SQL Database Projects extension:

1. [Create a new database project](#create-an-empty-database-project) by going to the **Database Projects** view or by searching for **Database Projects: New** in the command palette.

1. [Existing database projects](#open-an-existing-project) can be opened via **Database Projects: Open existing** in the command palette.

1. [Start from an existing database](#create-a-database-project-from-an-existing-database) by using **Database Projects: Create Project from Database** from the command palette or by selecting **Create Project from Database** in the **Connections** view.

After you create or open a SQL project, you're ready to start developing with SQL projects. Some actions you might take are:

- Edit a table or other database objects.
- Build and publish the project.
- Use schema compare to visualize changes.
- Update the project from changes made to a database.

For in-depth information about SQL projects concepts and more tutorials, see [SQL database projects](../../sql-database-projects/sql-database-projects.md).

## Create an empty database project

In the **Database Projects** view, select the **New Project** button and enter a project name in the text input that appears. In the **Select a Folder** dialog, select a directory for the project's folder, `.sqlproj` file, and other contents.
The extension opens the empty project and makes it visible in the **Database Projects** view for editing.

## Open an existing project

In the **Database Projects** view, select the **Open Project** button and open an existing `.sqlproj` file from the file picker that appears. Existing projects can originate from Visual Studio Code or [Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools](../../../ssdt/sql-server-data-tools.md).

The project opens and you can see its contents in the **Database Projects** view for editing.

## Create a database project from an existing database

Instead of starting from an empty project, you can quickly populate a SQL Database Project with the existing objects from a database.

### In Object Explorer

In the **Connections** view, connect to the SQL instance that contains the database to extract. Right-click on the database and select **Create Project from Database** from the context menu.

The folder structure setting is set to *Schema/Object Type* by default and offers different ways to automatically organize the existing objects when they're scripted out. The options for the folder structure setting are:

- File: a single file is created for all the objects.
- Flat: a single folder is created for all the objects, with each object in an individual file.
- Object Type: a folder is created per object type, and each object is scripted out to a file.
- Schema: a folder is created per schema, and each object is scripted out to a file.
- Schema/Object Type: a folder is created per schema, and within the folder, a folder is created per object type, with each object scripted out to a file.

### In Database Projects view

In the **Project** view, select the **Import Project from Database** button and connect to a SQL instance. Once the connection is established, select a database from the list of available databases and set the name of the project.

Finally, select a folder structure for the extraction. The new project opens and contains SQL scripts for the contents of the selected database.

## Further actions

### Build and publish

You deploy the database project in the SQL Database Projects extension by building the project into a [data-tier application file](../../sql-database-projects/concepts/data-tier-applications/overview.md) (dacpac) and publishing it to a supported platform. In the **Database Projects** view, right-click on a project and select **Build** to create a dacpac file and validate the SQL project. When you're ready to deploy your project to a database, right-click on the project again and select **Publish** to publish the dacpac to a database.

For more information, see the [tutorial on creating and deploying a SQL project](../../sql-database-projects/tutorials/create-deploy-sql-project.md).

### Schema compare

The SQL Database Projects extension works with [Schema Compare](../mssql/mssql-schema-compare.md). You can use it to compare the contents of a project to a dacpac, existing database, or another project. Use the resulting schema comparison to view and apply the differences from source to target.

For more information about schema comparison and SQL projects, see the [Schema comparison overview](../../sql-database-projects/concepts/schema-comparison.md).

### Update project from database

If you make changes to a database that you didn't make to the SQL project yet, you can update the SQL project from the state of the database. To update the project, select **Update Project from Database** from the context menu of a database in the **Connections** view or from the context menu of a SQL project in the **Database Projects** view. Keeping a SQL project up to date with changes in a database is one method of source control for database changes.
